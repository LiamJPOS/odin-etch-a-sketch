# Odin Etch-A-Sketch

This is a web-based Etch-A-Sketch application created to practice and improve skills in DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is in partial fulfillment of completing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). 

The purpose of this project is to allow users to create drawings by hovering over a grid of squares, with options to customize the grid size and clear the canvas.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Creation:** Allows users to create a grid of squares with customizable dimensions ranging from 1x1 to 100x100.
- **Drawing Interaction:** Users can draw on the canvas by hovering over the grid squares with their mouse cursor.
- **Opacity Effect:** The opacity of the squares increases each time they are hovered over, creating a drawing effect.
- **Clear Canvas:** Provides a button that allows users to clear the canvas and start drawing anew.
